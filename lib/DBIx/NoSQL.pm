=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::NoSQL is a layer over DBI that presents a NoSQLish way to store and retrieve data. It does this by using a table called C<__Store__>. Once connected to a database, it will detect if this table is missing and create it if necessary

When writing data to the store, the data (a HASH reference) is first serialized using L<JSON> and then inserted/updated via L<DBIx::Class> to (currently) an SQLite backend

Retrieving data from the store is done by key lookup or by searching an SQL-based index. Once found, the data is deserialized via L<JSON> and returned

The API is fairly sane, though still beta

=head1 USAGE

=head2 $store = DBIx::NoSQL->connect( $path )

Returns a new DBIx::NoSQL store connected to the SQLite database located at C<$path>

If the SQLite database file at C<$path> does not exist, it will be created

=head2 $store->set( $model, $key, $value )

Set C<$key> (a string) to C<$value> (a HASH reference) in C<$model>

If C<$model> has index, this command will also update the index entry corresponding to C<$key>

=head2 $value = $store->exists( $model, $key )

Returns true if some data for C<$key> is present in C<$model>

=head2 $value = $store->get( $model, $key )

Get C<$value> matching C<$key> in C<$model>

=head2 $value = $store->delete( $model, $key )

Delete the entry matching C<$key> in C<$model>

If C<$model> has index, this command will also delete the index entry corresponding to C<$key>

=head2 $store->reindex

Reindex the searchable/orderable data in C<$store>

This method is smart, in that it won't reindex a model unless the schema for $store is different/has changed. That is, if the schema for C<$store> is the same as it is in the database, this call will do nothing

Refer to "Model USAGE" below for more information

=head2 $store->dbh

Return the L<DBI> database handle for the store, if you need/want to do your own thing

=head1 Search USAGE

To search on a model, you must have installed an index on the field you want to search on

Refer to "Model USAGE" for indexing information

=head2 $search = $store->search( $model, [ $where ] )

    $search = $store->search( 'Artist' => { name => { -like => 'Smashing%' } } )

Return a L<DBIx::NoSQL::Search> object for C<$model>, filtering on the optional C<$where>

An index is required for the filtering columns

Refer to L<SQL::Abstract> for the format of C<$where> (actually uses L<DBIx::Class::SQLMaker> under the hood)

=head2 @all = $search->all

Returns every result for C<$search> in a list

Returns an empty list if nothing is found

=head2 $result = $search->next

Returns the next item found for C<$search> via C<< $search->cursor >>

Returns undef if nothing is left for C<$search> 

=head2 $sth = $search->cursor->sth

Returns the L<DBI> sth (statement handle) for C<$search>

=head2 $search = $search->search( $where )

Further refine the search in the same way C<< $search->where( ... ) >> does

=head2 $search = $search->where( $where )

    $search = $search->where( { genre => 'rock' } ) 

Further refine C<$search> with the given C<$where>

A new object is cloned from the original (the original C<$search> is left untouched)

An index is required for the filtering columns

Refer to L<SQL::Abstract> for the format of C<$where> (actually uses L<DBIx::Class::SQLMaker> under the hood)

=head2 $search = $search->order_by( $order_by )

    $search->order_by( 'name DESC' )

    $search->order_by([ 'name DESC', 'age' ])

Return the results in the given order

A new object is cloned from the original, which is left untouched

An index is required for the ordering columns

Refer to L<SQL::Abstract> for the format of C<$order_by> (actually uses L<DBIx::Class::SQLMaker> under the hood)

=head1 Model USAGE

=head2 $model = $store->model( $model_name )

Retrieve or create the C<$model_name> model object

=head2 $model->index( $field_name )

    $store->model( 'Artist' )->index( 'name' ) # 'name' is now searchable/orderable, etc.

Index C<$field_name> on C<$model>

Every time the store for c<$model> is written to, the index will be updated with the value of C<$field>

=head2 $model->index( $field_name, isa => $type )

    $store->model( 'Artist' )->index( 'website', isa => 'URI' )
    $store->model( 'Artist' )->index( 'founded', isa => 'DateTime' )

Index C<$field_name> on C<$model> as a special type/object (e.g. L<DateTime> or L<URI>)

Every time the store for c<$model> is written to, the index will be updated with the deflated value of C<$field> (since
L<JSON> can not trivially serialize blessed references)

=head2 $model->reindex

Reindex the C<$model> data in the store after making a field indexing change:

    1. Rebuild the DBIx::Class::ResultSource
    2. Drop and recreate the search table for $model
    3. Iterate through all the data for $model, repopulating the search table

If C<$model> does not have an index, this method will simply return

To rebuild the index for _every_ model (on startup, for example), you can do:

    $store->reindex

=head1 In the future

Create a better interface for stashing and document it

Wrap things in transactions that need it

More tests: Always. Be. Testing.
